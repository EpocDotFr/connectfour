</p>

## Features

  - All the Connect Four rules
  - State of the art graphics
  - Chips that made the player win are highlighted
  - Sound effects!
  - Musics!
  - Player's score
  - Two players, either:
    - On the same computer
    - (WIP) LAN game
    - (WIP) Online game

## Prerequisites

Python 3. May eventually works with Python 2 (not tested).

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then the usual `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

```
python run.py [--dev]
```

`--dev` enable WIP features (like network games).

### Controls

  - <kbd>ESC</kbd> quits to the menu or close the game when already on the menu
  - <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd> moves the chip respectively to the left and to the right
  - <kbd>↓</kbd> drops the chip in the selected column
  - <kbd>↵</kbd> starts a new game when one is finished

## How it works

This game is built on top of [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html). I obviously can't explain how it
works here, so you'll have to jump yourself in the source code. Start with the entry point, `run.py`.

Beside the game itself, I use [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) to generate the executables. It packs up all the
game and its assets in a single executable file so players just have to run it with nothing to install. This task is
performed by the `build_*` scripts to be run in the corresponding OS.

Network gaming is done by [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) using [Autobahn](http://autobahn.ws/python/).
A [master server](https://github.com/EpocDotFr/connectfour-master-server) (with the help of a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
API) is used to centralize all the online Connect Four games.

## Gotcha

This is my very first game I ever crafted, and my very first projet using PyGame, so please be indulgent.
